A program that practices formatting and database storage.

As an introduction to structs and the wide world of extreme character formatting, this assignment was intended for students to pay close attention to how to have outputs line up correctly. Additionally, as an introduction to structs, the project focused on the main elements necessary for a functional database: create, modify, delete, view.

The program has some hard-coded fake members to start with, but those can be changed to whatever amusing thing that strikes your fancy.

This program is not robust and relies on scanf for a lot of its input, and is susceptible to foul play.

For Portfolio use.
